## Design
 ### Colour Scheme
![colours](https://res.cloudinary.com/dksu5snru/image/upload/v1675396933/Screenshot_1282_llbmaf.png)
### Typography
        - The Josefin Slab font is used for the logo with Serif as the fallback font. I think this font has a contemporary look, while being playful enough to suit the theme of the site.
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the body of the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
 ### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, calming aesthetic.

 ### Wireframes

 #### Home Page Wireframe:
